# Lese

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/lese.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/lese)

Easy to use and extremely lightweight layout framework built for styled-components and soon to be ported to emotion.

Lese was inspired after using Laco, an extremely lightweight package for state management with packages for inferno and react. Lese's goal is to provide a powerful set of tools to quickly build layouts in styled-components while being just under 2KBs in size when gzipped. The project is in early alpha so bugs and breaking API changes are to be expected between minor releases before the first major release.

## Features

- ðŸ”¥ Extremely lightweight - <2KBs gzipped
- ðŸ“¦ Out of the box support for Grid and Flex
- ðŸš€ Move from design to prototype faster

## How It Works
